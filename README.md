# X Education Lead Conversion Prediction
### Project Overview
This project aims to help X Education, an online course provider, improve its lead conversion rate using a Logistic Regression model. The model assigns a probability score to each lead, predicting the likelihood of conversion based on various features such as user behavior and lead origin.

### Key Features

**Lead Prioritization**: Helps the sales team focus on high-potential leads by scoring them based on conversion probability.

**Data-Driven Strategy**: Provides actionable insights to improve conversion efficiency and sales outreach.

**Scalable Model**: The logistic regression model can be easily extended or adapted for similar datasets in different industries.

### Libraries Used

**pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.

**NumPy**: For numerical operations.

**Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.

**Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the Logistic Regression model.

**Statsmodels**: For generating detailed regression summaries and interpreting model coefficients.

### Model Summary

**Logistic Regression**: A binary classification algorithm was used to predict whether a lead will convert into a customer or not.

**Key Variables**: Features like Total Time Spent on Website, Occupation (Working Professional), and Lead Origin significantly impact conversion likelihood.
